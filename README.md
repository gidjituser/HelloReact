## Introduction

 An App View (μApp) is like a micro or light weight application that will execute a well defined task or action. It may allow a user to to configure it if necessary and is displayed within a single view.
 
 See the official [React Native website](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for an introduction to React Native.

## Getting Started
 
 - Follow the [Getting Started guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) to install React Native and its dependencies.
 - Please look at the package.json of this example to see what additional npm packages are available in Gidjit. 
 
### What Gidjit will require to run

* Build/Config Project 

 - After creating your project generate a bundle in the root of the directory called "main.ios.jsbundle" (for example [from the root of the directory] run: react-native bundle --platform ios --dev false --entry-file views/ios/index.ios.js --bundle-output main.ios.jsbundle)
 - Optionally add an icon.png to the root of the directory preferably 120x120px
 - Upload your entire project to Github. Make sure you have an appropriate gitignore you can use the one from this example as a good start. 

* Add the micro app (μApp) to Gidjit 
 
 - Select a Launcher Panel
 - Select Add Built-in/Known actions 
 - From the available action list select React Native Action View
 - Gidjit will acquire the project through the online zip file generated by Github. Press select Github Zip and search for your repository in the WebView. When a link for your project zip is found you will be able to select it. Alternatively you can directly enter the URL of your desired zip in the text field below.
