# Description

This is a basic example for creating a React Native App View (Î¼App) that can be added and run in Gidjit ~ Smart Launcher, available in the [AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gidjit-smart-launcher/id1179176359?at=1001lnP4&mt=8)
 (currently iOS only)

Supported operating system(s) are iOS 10.0+

## Introduction

Gidjit is great for accessing and launching apps/actions from your iDevice. This current repo has a React Native bundled app that can be used as a demo from Gidjit. To run the demo follow the instructions at

**[react-native-gidjit](https://github.com/gidjituser/react-native-gidjit)**

The new approach is very simple and requires at most two simple scripts to be run.

### Running this on your device
**You can try these Demo by scanning from you iPhone/iPad's photo app. Make sure Gidjit is installed first**
